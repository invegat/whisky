    "DESCRIPTION": "In the year 2018 Macallan, the most famous brand in whisky, opened a new award willing \u00a3140 Million Pound distillery. This is the second release to celebrate this great occasion. The first release was the Macallan Genesis, where people travelled from all over the globe to be in with a chance of securing such an elusive bottle. There were even rumours of people swimming across the river Spey to secure their spot in the line. This is the second release and is one of only 600, also going under the Genesis name.\nAt the time of writing this piece, this is the oldest ever Macallan to be bottled in what can only be described as a piece of art. This Genesis Lalique decanter holds liquid that was distilled in the 1940s and lay to mature for an exceptional 72 years. The distillery has won multiple awards for its design and architecture and the bottle shape/character certainly reflects its unique design. Burgess Studio was given the honour of designing such a unique piece of history and its vessel for transport was designed and crafted by NEJ Stevenson.\nMacallan said: \"Lalique has captured the character of the new Distillery in crystal, with the horizon of the decanter rising and falling in reflection of the roof line and incorporating the clean lines and natural curves. Each decanter is encased in a bespoke presentation case inspired by the interior of the Distillery, with a curved wooden roof over the decanter, and a footprint taken directly from the circular layout of the three new still houses.\"\n\u00a0Nick Savage, Master distiller at the time said - \u2018For its 72 years of maturation, the deceptively light colour hints that this is not an ordinary single malt. Reminiscent of a time gone by, it carries an exquisite balance of strong, sweet oak with the peaty spirit shaping its refined character.\u2019\n"

This was adapted for cinema in 1949 and again in 2016.\nThe bottle was recovered by diver George Currie, director of Currie Brothers Limited and can be seen in the picture bottom left. While working on a subsea cable repair from South Uist - Eriskay, the team located the wreck.\u00a0\nGeorge said: \"As you can see with the smile on our faces, it was a great days diving\".\u00a0\nEveryone in the whisky world is well aware of the significance of the SS Politician, which is why its story has been adapted for cinema twice. The whisky onboard ranged\u00a0from Gilbey\u2019s, Ballantine\u2019s, VAT 69 and more.\u00a0\nThis lot comes with the original poster, diving helmet and bricks from the ship.\u00a0\n"

However, tough times throughout the Scotch Whisky industry followed and the distillery closed for quite sometime. However, Glenmorangie PLC saw the calibre of the distillery and purchased it in 1996. It then was bought over by the French giants LVMH on the 28th of December 2004.\nMichael \"Mickey\" Heads, an Islay originally and he was a former manager at\u00a0Jura\u00a0who had worked at Ardbeg years earlier, took over on 12 March 2007 until 2020. The new manager, Colin Gordon is set to take over the helm and drive e the company forward to even greater success.\nThis is a younger cask strength version of the very popular\u00a0Uigeadeal. This expression was introduced in 2003 and only 1392 bottles were released.\n\u00a0\n"

The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis 21 year old was distilled in 1973 and is a real collectors item!\n"

This expression has been bottled for Royal Mile Whiskies. Daftmill is a farm distillery. Owned and operated by the Cuthbert family, it only runs in the farm's quiet periods; midsummer and winter, sometimes producing as few as 100 casks per year.\nWhen not distilling Francis Cuthbert looks after the estate, growing the malting barley used to make this lowland whisky. This single cask is a perfect representation of the Daftmill style and was voted for democratically by the Royal Mile Whiskies tasting team. Such a thorough investigation of the warehouses was only made possible with Mr Cuthbert's generosity and patience, as well as Mrs Cuthbert's delicious baking.\u00a0\nThis is bottle number 137.\n"

    "DESCRIPTION": "Islay\u2019s oldest working distillery, Bowmore was established in 1779 and is now regarded as one of the most popular malts not only on Islay, but in the whole of Scotland. The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis independent release is to commemorate the 51st anniversary of the Apollo Moon Landing in 1969. Distilled in 2002 and bottled in 2020 this 1st fill Oloroso Hogshead yielded only 270 bottles. Out of this world...and beyond!\u00a0\n"

A year after the distillery closed in 2004 Italian raconteur Luca Gargano headed to Trinidad and came across the derelict distillery. On a photoshoot he stumbled across a warehouse full of Caroni barrels and in the next few years the barrels were purchased.\nThe distillery now has legendary status among collectors and fans.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Islay\u2019s oldest working distillery, Bowmore was established in 1779 and is now regarded as one of the most popular malts not only on Islay, but in the whole of Scotland. The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nIn May 1813 during the war, a French soldier was captured by his British enemies (St Ives).\nHe actually escaped prison, fought recapture and escaped from his enemies in a hot air balloon.\u00a0\n"

Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nIn May 1813 during the war, a French soldier was captured by his British enemies (St Ives).\nHe actually escaped prison, fought recapture and escaped from his enemies in a hot air balloon.\u00a0\n"

Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\n\u00a0The unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis 25-Year-old expression is one from a small batch release and bottled at 43%.\u00a0\n"

It has been bottled exclusively for Duty Zero in Hong Kong.\u00a0\n"
