Being a poor man he could not afford to replace it but devised a cunning plan. He carried the old still to the nearby peat moor, where it was buried and the spot marked with a sheep's skull.\nSome weeks later he met the Customs man in the local Inn. In conversation, Donnachie explained that he had turned over a new leaf and his days of illicit whisky making were gone forever. The Customs man was pleased but suspicious, so to prove his new character, Donnachie volunteered to take the Customs man to where he knew an illegal still was hidden.\nAt midnight they set out across the peat moor. After much searching they found a sheep's skull and Donnachie suggested they start digging. As they dug through the soft peat they struck the copper still.\nThe Customs man, delighted with such a find, proudly carried the still back to Bowmore village where he and Donnachie enjoyed a few drams of the Bowmore Malt in celebration. Donnachie was given a handsome reward for reporting the illegal still. The reward enabled Donnachie to purchase a brand new larger illegal still!\n"},

Matured in refill Hogsheads, this malt has taken on very little oak influence which has allowed the air and liquid in the casks to interact and develop a wide array of tropical fruit flavours.\n1980sFINISHED IN FIRST FILL OLOROSO SHERRY BUTTS: DISTILLED ON 02/12/1988Tomatin from the 1980\u2019s is sweet and fresh. This malt has been finished for over three years in 1st fill Oloroso Sherry Butts, resulting in a whisky reminiscent of aged Cognac. Tones of aged leather, polished oak and dark roast coffee along with flavours of stone fruit, dark chocolate and tannin add richness.\n1990sFIRST FILL BOURBON BARRELS: DISTILLED ON 04/10/1995The use of 1st fill Bourbon Barrels has developed a malt with characteristics of golden syrup, freshly baked pastries with subtle spices and add a layer of warmth. Although well into its twenties, Tomatin from the 1990\u2019s is bold which helps impart long length to the overall finish.\n2000s RECHARRED VERDEJO WINE BARRELS: DISTILLED ON 28/01/2000 AND 05/06/2009\nFrom 2000 onwards Tomatin began to experiment with a wider variety of casks. The malt used from the 2000\u2019s has been matured in Verdejo Wine casks which have been re-charred to harness the full influence of the French oak. This adds sweetness as well as some spicier notes.2010s\nSECOND FILL FRENCH OAK BARRELS: DISTILLED ON 14/03/2013\nYoung Tomatin in second fill casks allows the distillery character to shine through. Fresh green fruits and malty characteristics are to the fore with subtle spice and toffee from the light French oak influence. This is a vivacious malt which adds lighter tones but is kept in balance with the older casks.\n"},

Sadly, by this point production was slowing down, and in 1968 things finally came to a halt, closing down the operation due to struggles with water supply.\nThankfully in 1973, Stanley P. Morrison, owner of Bowmore and Auchentoshan, came to the rescue; securing a new water source and reopening the distillery. He also introduced innovative heat recovery systems, which were not just of benefit to the distillery, but the surrounding town as well, heating greenhouses and the local swimming pool.\nThis Glen Garioch has been aged for 15 years in the Aberdeenshire village of Old Meldrum.\u00a0\n"},
