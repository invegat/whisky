This offering was previously only available at travel retail, though luckily a few bottles have made it onto our shelves. Glenmorangie the Tayne takes its inspiration from the legend of a Spanish man-o\u2019-war ship that was wrecked off the coast close to the distillery. The whisky seeks to recreate the profile of a \u201cSpanish treasure\u201d. This whisky takes Glenmorangie\u2019s classic floral, biscuity flavours, and adds another layer of sherried complexity. Amontillado is a type of sherry typified as being darker than Fino but lighter than Oloroso, with an excellent balance between the dry and sweet characteristics of both sherries.\nIt was, of course, immortalised by Edgar Allen Poe in his classic gothic short story, The Cask of Amontillado. There are no horror stories here however, with Glenmorangie the Tayne being a superb whisky, with excellent, sophisticated flavours of dry wine, almonds and honey. This whisky is bottled at 43%, and in a litre size.\n"},
