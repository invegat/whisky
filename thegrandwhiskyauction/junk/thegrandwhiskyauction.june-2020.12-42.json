Being a poor man he could not afford to replace it but devised a cunning plan. He carried the old still to the nearby peat moor, where it was buried and the spot marked with a sheep's skull.\nSome weeks later he met the Customs man in the local Inn. In conversation, Donnachie explained that he had turned over a new leaf and his days of illicit whisky making were gone forever. The Customs man was pleased but suspicious, so to prove his new character, Donnachie volunteered to take the Customs man to where he knew an illegal still was hidden.\nAt midnight they set out across the peat moor. After much searching they found a sheep's skull and Donnachie suggested they start digging. As they dug through the soft peat they struck the copper still.\nThe Customs man, delighted with such a find, proudly carried the still back to Bowmore village where he and Donnachie enjoyed a few drams of the Bowmore Malt in celebration. Donnachie was given a handsome reward for reporting the illegal still. The reward enabled Donnachie to purchase a brand new larger illegal still!\n"},

This offering was previously only available at travel retail, though luckily a few bottles have made it onto our shelves. Glenmorangie the Tayne takes its inspiration from the legend of a Spanish man-o\u2019-war ship that was wrecked off the coast close to the distillery. The whisky seeks to recreate the profile of a \u201cSpanish treasure\u201d. This whisky takes Glenmorangie\u2019s classic floral, biscuity flavours, and adds another layer of sherried complexity. Amontillado is a type of sherry typified as being darker than Fino but lighter than Oloroso, with an excellent balance between the dry and sweet characteristics of both sherries.\nIt was, of course, immortalised by Edgar Allen Poe in his classic gothic short story, The Cask of Amontillado. There are no horror stories here however, with Glenmorangie the Tayne being a superb whisky, with excellent, sophisticated flavours of dry wine, almonds and honey. This whisky is bottled at 43%, and in a litre size.\n"},
