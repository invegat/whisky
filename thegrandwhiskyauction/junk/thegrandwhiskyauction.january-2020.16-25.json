Amontillado is a type of sherry typified as being darker than Fino but lighter than Oloroso, with an excellent balance between the dry and sweet characteristics of both sherries.\nIt was, of course, immortalised by Edgar Allen Poe in his classic gothic short story, The Cask of Amontillado. There are no horror stories here however, with Glenmorangie the Tayne being a superb whisky, with excellent, sophisticated flavours of dry wine, almonds and honey.
