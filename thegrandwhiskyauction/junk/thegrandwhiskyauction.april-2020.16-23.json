Sadly, by this point production was slowing down, and in 1968 things finally came to a halt, closing down the operation due to struggles with water supply.\nThankfully in 1973, Stanley P. Morrison, owner of Bowmore and Auchentoshan, came to the rescue; securing a new water source and reopening the distillery. He also introduced innovative heat recovery systems, which were not just of benefit to the distillery, but the surrounding town as well, heating greenhouses and the local swimming pool.\nThis Glen Garioch has been aged for 15 years in the Aberdeenshire village of Old Meldrum.\u00a0\n"},
