The series is rumoured to be of three parts after maturing the spirit in sherry and being moved into ex-bourbon casks.\nConcept Number 2 is a creation by our good friend and Macallan whisky maker Steven Bremner. It revolves around his two great passions, Whisky and Music.\n\u201cBuilding music is in some ways the same as building whisky.\n\u201cIn music, you have to lay down the base track, just like you create the base flavour in whisky, and then you build layers around them.\u201d\nConcept No. 2 has been matured in Sherry-seasoned American oak casks, Miguel Martin Sherry casks and ex-Bourbon barrels.\n"},
