The 16 year old, aged in oak casks has truly become a benchmark Islay dram from the Lagavulin distillery.\nThis whisky was The Runner Up in TWE's Whisky of the Year 2014 &\u00a02015 Silver Outstanding Medal Winner - International Wine & Spirits Competition amongst other accolades.\u00a0\nWhite Horse Edition is very appealing to collectors and is fast disappearing.\n"
