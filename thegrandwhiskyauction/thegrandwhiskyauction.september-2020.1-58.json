This is the second release to celebrate this great occasion. The first release was the Macallan Genesis, where people travelled from all over the globe to be in with a chance of securing such an elusive bottle. There were even rumours of people swimming across the river Spey to secure their spot in the line. This is the second release and is one of only 600, also going under the Genesis name.\nAt the time of writing this piece, this is the oldest ever Macallan to be bottled in what can only be described as a piece of art. This Genesis Lalique decanter holds liquid that was distilled in the 1940s and lay to mature for an exceptional 72 years. The distillery has won multiple awards for its design and architecture and the bottle shape/character certainly reflects its unique design. Burgess Studio was given the honour of designing such a unique piece of history and its vessel for transport was designed and crafted by NEJ Stevenson.\nMacallan said: \"Lalique has captured the character of the new Distillery in crystal, with the horizon of the decanter rising and falling in reflection of the roof line and incorporating the clean lines and natural curves. Each decanter is encased in a bespoke presentation case inspired by the interior of the Distillery, with a curved wooden roof over the decanter, and a footprint taken directly from the circular layout of the three new still houses.\"\n\u00a0Nick Savage, Master distiller at the time said - \u2018For its 72 years of maturation, the deceptively light colour hints that this is not an ordinary single malt. Reminiscent of a time gone by, it carries an exquisite balance of strong, sweet oak with the peaty spirit shaping its refined character.\u2019\n"},

The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis 21 year old was distilled in 1973 and is a real collectors item!\n"},

This expression has been bottled for Royal Mile Whiskies. Daftmill is a farm distillery. Owned and operated by the Cuthbert family, it only runs in the farm's quiet periods; midsummer and winter, sometimes producing as few as 100 casks per year.\nWhen not distilling Francis Cuthbert looks after the estate, growing the malting barley used to make this lowland whisky. This single cask is a perfect representation of the Daftmill style and was voted for democratically by the Royal Mile Whiskies tasting team. Such a thorough investigation of the warehouses was only made possible with Mr Cuthbert's generosity and patience, as well as Mrs Cuthbert's delicious baking.\u00a0\nThis is bottle number 137.\n"},

The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years.

Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis independent release is to commemorate the 51st anniversary of the Apollo Moon Landing in 1969.

Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nIn May 1813 during the war, a French soldier was captured by his British enemies (St Ives).\nHe actually escaped prison, fought recapture and escaped from his enemies in a hot air balloon.\u00a0\n"},

The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nIn May 1813 during the war, a French soldier was captured by his British enemies (St Ives).\nHe actually escaped prison, fought recapture and escaped from his enemies in a hot air balloon.\u00a0\n"},

The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\n\u00a0The unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years.
