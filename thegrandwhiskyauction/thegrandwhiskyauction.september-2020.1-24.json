    "DESCRIPTION": "In the year 2018 Macallan, the most famous brand in whisky, opened a new award willing \u00a3140 Million Pound distillery. This is the second release to celebrate this great occasion. The first release was the Macallan Genesis, where people travelled from all over the globe to be in with a chance of securing such an elusive bottle. There were even rumours of people swimming across the river Spey to secure their spot in the line. This is the second release and is one of only 600, also going under the Genesis name.\nAt the time of writing this piece, this is the oldest ever Macallan to be bottled in what can only be described as a piece of art. This Genesis Lalique decanter holds liquid that was distilled in the 1940s and lay to mature for an exceptional 72 years. The distillery has won multiple awards for its design and architecture and the bottle shape/character certainly reflects its unique design. Burgess Studio was given the honour of designing such a unique piece of history and its vessel for transport was designed and crafted by NEJ Stevenson.\nMacallan said: \"Lalique has captured the character of the new Distillery in crystal, with the horizon of the decanter rising and falling in reflection of the roof line and incorporating the clean lines and natural curves. Each decanter is encased in a bespoke presentation case inspired by the interior of the Distillery, with a curved wooden roof over the decanter, and a footprint taken directly from the circular layout of the three new still houses.\"\n\u00a0Nick Savage, Master distiller at the time said - \u2018For its 72 years of maturation, the deceptively light colour hints that this is not an ordinary single malt. Reminiscent of a time gone by, it carries an exquisite balance of strong, sweet oak with the peaty spirit shaping its refined character.\u2019\n"

The bottle comes from one of the most famous\u00a0shipwrecks in history, the S.S Politician.\u00a0\nThe SS Politician ran aground off the shores of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides in 1941.\nThe salvage operation by divers, islanders, and the efforts of custom and excise officials to frustrate this, inspired the novel Whisky Galore. This was adapted for cinema in 1949 and again in 2016.\nThe bottle was recovered by diver George Currie, director of Currie Brothers Limited and can be seen in the picture bottom left. While working on a subsea cable repair from South Uist - Eriskay, the team located the wreck.\u00a0\nGeorge said: \"As you can see with the smile on our faces, it was a great days diving\".\u00a0\nEveryone in the whisky world is well aware of the significance of the SS Politician, which is why its story has been adapted for cinema twice. The whisky onboard ranged\u00a0from Gilbey\u2019s, Ballantine\u2019s, VAT 69 and more.\u00a0\nThis lot comes with the original poster, diving helmet and bricks from the ship.\u00a0\n"

    "DESCRIPTION": "Islay\u2019s oldest working distillery, Bowmore was established in 1779 and is now regarded as one of the most popular malts not only on Islay, but in the whole of Scotland. The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis 21 year old was distilled in 1973 and is a real collectors item!\n"

This expression has been bottled for Royal Mile Whiskies. Daftmill is a farm distillery. Owned and operated by the Cuthbert family, it only runs in the farm's quiet periods; midsummer and winter, sometimes producing as few as 100 casks per year.\nWhen not distilling Francis Cuthbert looks after the estate, growing the malting barley used to make this lowland whisky. This single cask is a perfect representation of the Daftmill style and was voted for democratically by the Royal Mile Whiskies tasting team. Such a thorough investigation of the warehouses was only made possible with Mr Cuthbert's generosity and patience, as well as Mrs Cuthbert's delicious baking.\u00a0\nThis is bottle number 137.\n"

On a photoshoot he stumbled across a warehouse full of Caroni barrels and in the next few years the barrels were purchased.\n\u00a0The distillery is now closed and this is the final release (39th).

A year after the distillery closed in 2004 Italian raconteur Luca Gargano headed to Trinidad and came across the derelict distillery. On a photoshoot he stumbled across a warehouse full of Caroni barrels and in the next few years the barrels were purchased.\n\u00a0The distillery is now closed and this is the final release (39th). It consists of 24 barrels that have been blended together, all of which are of the heaviest calibre. This special release was bottled in 2019.\u00a0\n"

    "DESCRIPTION": "Islay\u2019s oldest working distillery, Bowmore was established in 1779 and is now regarded as one of the most popular malts not only on Islay, but in the whole of Scotland. The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis independent release is to commemorate the 51st anniversary of the Apollo Moon Landing in 1969. Distilled in 2002 and bottled in 2020 this 1st fill Oloroso Hogshead yielded only 270 bottles. Out of this world...and beyond!\u00a0\n"

The company built strong ties over the years with distillers and distilleries over Scotland. They eventually run their own casks to different distilleries to be filled and this resulted in a superb collection of casks from different distilleries. As it transpires, many of these are now closed. Lucky for them, their casks are maturing nicely in their warehouses! Euan Shand\u00a0took over the company in 2001, who has a wide range of industry experience and has has time at Glendronach distillery, William Teacher\u2019s & Sons, and founding/running The Bennachie Whisky Company.\nThis Glen Grant has been matured for over 36 years in cask #16560 and was bottled in 2001.

The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nIn May 1813 during the war, a French soldier was captured by his British enemies (St Ives).\nHe actually escaped prison, fought recapture and escaped from his enemies in a hot air balloon.\u00a0\n"

The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\nThe unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nIn May 1813 during the war, a French soldier was captured by his British enemies (St Ives).\nHe actually escaped prison, fought recapture and escaped from his enemies in a hot air balloon.\u00a0\n"

In the very early days they used a cast iron pot still, which in later years was replaced with a single column style still. Caroni became famous for its very distinctive heavy style of rum.\n A year after the distillery closed in 2004 Italian raconteur Luca Gargano headed to Trinidad and came across the derelict distillery. On a photoshoot he stumbled across a warehouse full of Caroni barrels and in the next few years the barrels were purchased.\n\u00a0The distillery is now closed but this 100 imperial proof edition was distilled and matured prior to the closure.\u00a0 It is a blend of 1996 vintage that has been aged for a minimum of 21 years in its home of Trinidad. A huge 86% was lost during this time period but what is left is sublime.\u00a0\n"

The distillery was acquired by Stanley P. Morrison in 1963, ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in 1993. The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.\n\u00a0The unique microclimate of the No.1 Vaults warehouse at Bowmore distillery means casks share very little with the angels, and has allowed the distillery to bottle some spectacular age-statements over the years. These early Morrison Bowmore era vintages are considered classics, particualrly this parcel of 1964 vintage sherry casks. Indeed, it is hard to fathom where whisky collecting would be today without the Black Bowmore.\u00a0\nThis 25-Year-old expression is one from a small batch release and bottled at 43%.\u00a0\n"

Caroni became famous for its very distinctive heavy style of rum.\n A year after the distillery closed in 2004 Italian raconteur Luca Gargano headed to Trinidad and came across the derelict distillery. On a photoshoot he stumbled across a warehouse full of Caroni barrels and in the next few years the barrels were purchased.\nThe distillery is now closed, however this bottle is still in high demand. It came from single cask #20 and was distilled in 1998. It is one of only 245 bottles.\u00a0\nThe Duchess is an Indy bottler from Europe.\u00a0\n"
